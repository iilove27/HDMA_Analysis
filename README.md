## Abstract:
In this paper, we constructed an empirical analysis to apply machine learning techniques to classify mortgage applications using the HMDA dataset. Moreover, we explored whether race plays an important role in the mortgage application process.We believe that the algorithms can not only be used to classify mortgage applications, but can also provide some insights for the regulatory departments to check the fairness of loan-granting procedure.
